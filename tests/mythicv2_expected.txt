### SCENE 1
__Setup__: 
### About - Mythicv2
Shortcuts for Mythic Variations 2.  This is an excellent "GM emulator" system for solo and GM'less gaming.  You can find more info about Mythic Variations 2 at [wordmill games](http://wordmillgames.com/mythic-variations-2.html).

Uses __tejs_state__ shortcut-file (optional).  It uses this to save & load the chaos value, the scene count, and "Details" mode.

Uses __tejs_lists__ shortcut-file (optional).  Adds and uses lists for pcs, npcs and threads.  If these llists have items, then the __event__ and __detail__ shortcuts will pick from the lists for their results.


### Reference - Mythicv2
- __reset mythicv2__ - Reset mythic state to defaults and displays scene heading.
- __mythicv2 details {state}__ - If {state} is given (must be "y" or "n"), assigns it to the mythicv2 "details" mode.  Otherwise, displays the current "details" mode.
***
- __detail__ - Make a detail check.
- __event__ - Make an event check.
- __fate {odds} {wanted}__ - Make a fate check based on {odds}: an optional number from -4 (impossible) to 4 (has to be), defaulting to 0 (50/50).  This is also based on {wanted}: an optional value of either 'n' or 'y', defaulting to 'y'.  The value {wanted} specifies the direction of the chaos modifier.
    - Alternative shortcut: __f {odds} {wanted}__.
- __meaning action__ - Roll on the action meaning table.
    - Alternative shortcut: __meaning__.
***
- __meaning description__ - Roll on the description meaning table.
- __scene__ - Show the current scene.
- __scene {chaosAdjust}__ - Shift the chaos value by {chaosAdjust} (1, 0 or -1), then increment the current scene and run a scene check.
- __chaos__ - Show the current chaos value.
- __chaos--__ - Decrease the chaos value by 1 (minimum of 3).
- __chaos++__ - Increase the chaos value by 1 (maximum of 6).
- __chaos={value}__ - Set the chaos value to {value}, an integer from 3 to 6.
***
- __descriptor__ - Generates a personality and activity descriptor for an NPC.
- __disposition {descriptor count}__ - Rolls for an NPC's disposition, modified by {descriptor count}: a required parameter representing the total of the NPC's activated descriptors (integer from -3 to 3).
    - Example: 2 positively activated descriptors and 1 negatively activated descriptor would make a {descriptor count} of __1+1+(-1) = 1__.
- __disposition {base} {descriptorCount}__ - Displays the NPC disposition determined by the {base} disposition, modified by {descriptorCount}.  See "disposition {descriptor count}" for an explanation of {descriptor count}.
- __action {dispositionAdjust}__ - Makes an NPC behavior check, modified by {dispositionAdjust}, the modifier of the NPC's disposition.
***
- __lists pick__ - This does nothing.  It's just a placeholder, for when "tejs_lists" isn't available.  Make sure "tejs_lists" comes before "tejs_mythicv2" in the shortcut-files list for mythicv3 to use lists.

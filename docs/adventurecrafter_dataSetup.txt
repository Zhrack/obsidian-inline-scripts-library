The adventurecrafter shortcut-file requires a data shortcut-file that I'm not making public for
copyright reasons.  If you have the Adventure Crafter pdf, then you can recreate the data
shortcut-file yourself without a terrible amount of effort, after which you can use the
adventurecrafter shortcut-file.

This document is an explanation of how to do that.

First is the shortcut-file's layout.  Below is the shortcut file, but with most of the data
replaced by ellipses (...).  I've left just enough data to illustrate the format that the data
is expected to be in.  The first step is to copy the following content into a note (I suggest
calling it "tejs_adventurecrafter_data", though it's ultimately up to you).  The rest of the steps
are to fill the note with data from the pdf.

Once you have the above content into a note in Obsidian, we want to fill it with data from the pdf.
The way to do this is to copy a table from the pdf, then use a regex editor, such as
https://regex101.com, to modify the text until it matches the format that we want.  In some cases,
the data lines will need reordering, which can be done with a spreadsheet application, such as
Google sheets.  I'll go over what to do for each table individually.



/////////////////////////////
// CHARACTER SPECIAL TRAIT //
/////////////////////////////
Copy the full table contents (but not the headings) into a regex app with substitution
capabilities.  https://regex101.com is what I'm using.  Copy the contents into "test string".  The
regex replace app needs to be in "substitution" mode.  With regex101, this is on the left side,
beneath the heading "FUNCTION".
Once the table content is in there, you'll enter a regex and substitution script pair to modify the
content.  Then you'll copy the result back into the input test string.  You'll keep adding
different regex and substitution pairs to modify the data, then copy the output back into the input
until it's in the format that we need.  Now I'll provide the regex and substitution script pairs
you need to work through.

regex:
[0-9]+-([0-9]+)
substitution:
^$1^

This substitution has a single space.  I've displayed it as an underscore here for visibility.
regex:
\n
substitution:
_

Before doing this regex, add a single space to the end of the content.
This regex has a space character, which I've (again) displayed as an underscore for visibility.
regex:
\^_
substitution:
\n

regex:
(.+): (.+) \^(.+)
substitution:
\t[ "$1", $3, "$2" ],

The data is in its final form now.  When you copy it in, make sure to remove the final comma.



///////////////////////////////////////////
// CHARACTER IDENTITIES AND DESCRIPTIONS //
///////////////////////////////////////////
Character identities and descriptions are two separate table, but the process is the same for both,
so I'll go over them together.
First copy the full table contents (but not the headings) into the regex app of your choice.  I've
covered setting this up in the "CHARACTER SPECIAL TRAIT" section, so read that first.
Then, run through the following process.

The substitution is a single space.  I've written it as an underscore here for visibility.
regex:
\n
substitution:
_

Manually change the "1-33" (or "1-21") in the first entry to just "33" (or "21").  Do the same to
the "99-100" near the end (if it's a two numbers, make it just "100").  The final one might be
spaced out.  Remove the extra spacing.

regex:
([0-9]+)
substitution:
^$1

regex:
\^
substitution:
\n\^

Ok, now for a wrinkle.  Copy the result into a spreadsheet app.  It should be a single column.
Select the entire column (by clicking on the column's heading).
Then, you want to click the menu "Data" then "Sort".  In the popup, just click "Ok".
This will produce a version of the list that is sorted (despite the leading ^ mark on each item).
It's possible that the "100" item is on the wrong end of the list.  Copy and paste the item into
the right spot manually.
Copy the sorted array back into the regex editor app.  Again, you can select the column heading
to select the entire column at once.

// This substitution is an empty string: no characters.
regex:
\n
substitution:


regex:
\^([0-9]+) ([^\^]+)
substitution:
["$2",$1],

// Here, as before, the regex has a space that is written as an underscore here for visibility.
regex:
_",
substitution:
",

Just one more step.  The first entry, the "roll for two ..." entry, should have an extra "true"
at the end of it's block.  So, change this...
["Roll for two Identities",33]
Into this...
["Roll for two Identities",33,true]

The data is in its final form now.  When you copy it in, make sure to remove the final comma.

////////////////////////////
// META PLOT POINTS TABLE //
////////////////////////////
For this table and for the "plot points" table we will be relying on the full table, not the
reduced table.  This means it includes the (often lengthy) description for each item.
So, like the others, copy the entire table into the regex application, except for the headings,
and paste it into the regex app.  Then go through these transformations:

regex:
[0-9]+\-([0-9]+)
substitution:
^$1^

Again, the underscore is used to signify a space character in this substitution string.
regex:
\n
substitution:
_

Before running this regex, add a single space to the end of the text.
There are many spaces in this regex and substitution.  I've written the regex's final space as an
underscore because it is, otherwise, hard to spot.  The others are easier to see, so I left them
as the space character.
regex:
([^\^]+): ([^\^]*) \^([^\^]*)\^_
substitution:
\t[ "$1", $3, "$2" ],\n

regex:
(?:“|”)
substitution:
\\"

The data is in its final form now.  When you copy it in, make sure to remove the final comma.

///////////////////////
// PLOT POINTS TABLE //
///////////////////////
For this table and for the "meta plot points" table we will be relying on
the full table, not the reduced table.
This is the big one.  It spans many pages.  You need to copy each page's table-contents (not
headings) into the regex application.  It could take a while.
Also, make sure there is a new line between each page's contents in the regex  app.
And, to emphasize, make sure you copy the full contents for each page, and do NOT copy the
heading text.

regex:
((?:(?:[0-9]+(?:\-[0-9]+)?)|\-) (?:(?:[0-9]+(?:\-[0-9]+)?)|\-) (?:(?:[0-9]+(?:\-[0-9]+)?)|\-) (?:(?:[0-9]+(?:\-[0-9]+)?)|\-) (?:(?:[0-9]+(?:\-[0-9]+)?)|\-))
substitution:
\^\n$1\n\^

regex:
[0-9]+\-([0-9]+)
substitution:
$1

__Repeat this regex 4 times.__
regex:
\^\n([^\-\n]*)\-([^~\n]*)\n\^
substitution
\^\n${1}0${2}\n\^

regex:
\^\n([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+)\n\^
substitution:
\^\n$1,$2,$3,$4,$5\n\^

__This regex has a single space for the substitution string (shown here as an underscore)__
regex:
\n
substitution:
_

__This regex has 2 spaces in the regex string (shown here as underscores).__
__Add a single space at the end before running this regex.__
regex:
_\^_
substitution:
\n

Add a blank newline at the top before running this regex.
regex:
\n([A-Z \-\'’!,]+): ([^\n]+)\n(.+)
substitution:
\n\t[ "$1", $3, "$2" ],

Finally, we need to add an extra value to a few entries.  The second entry, "NONE", needs an
extra 1 at the end.  So change this:
[ "NONE", 24,24,24,24,24, "Leave this Plot Point blank and go on to the next Plot Point, unless it would leave you with fewer than 2 Plot Points in this Turning Point, in which case re-roll." ]
to this:
[ "NONE", 24,24,24,24,24, "Leave this Plot Point blank and go on to the next Plot Point, unless it would leave you with fewer than 2 Plot Points in this Turning Point, in which case re-roll.", 1 ]

And the final entry is "META" and needs an extra 2 at the end.  So change this:
[ "META", 100,100,100,100,100, "This is a special Plot Point category with Plot Points that change the Characters List or combine Plotlines. Go to the Meta Plot Points Table and roll 1d100 on it for your Plot Point." ]
to this:
[ "META", 100,100,100,100,100, "This is a special Plot Point category with Plot Points that change the Characters List or combine Plotlines. Go to the Meta Plot Points Table and roll 1d100 on it for your Plot Point.", 2 ]

The data is in its final form now.  When you copy it in, make sure to remove the final comma, and
any extra lines at the top and bottom.
